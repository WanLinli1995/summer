is 1154646 4564the process of 234789imicking the outwardly observable behavior to match an existing target. The internal
state of the emulation mechanism does not have to accurately reflect the internal state of the target which it is
emulating.

Simulation, on the other hand, involves modeling the underlying state of the target. The end result of a good
simulation is that the simulation model will emulate the target which it is simulating.

Ideally, you should be able to look into the simulation and observe properties that you would also see if you
looked into the original target. In practice, there may some shortcuts to the simulation for performance reasons
-- that is, some internal aspects of the simulation may actually be an emulation.

MAME is an arcade game emulator; Hyperterm is a (not very good) terminal emulator. There's no need to model the
arcade machine or a terminal in detail to get the desired emulated behavior.

Flight Simulator is a simulator; SPICE is an electronics simulator. They model as much as possible every detail
of the target to represent what the target does in reality.

EDIT: Other responses have pointed out that the goal of an emulation is to able to substitute for the object it
is emulating. That's an important point. A simulation's focus is more on the modelling of the internal state of
the target -- and the simulation does not necessarily lead to emulation. In particular, a simulation may run far
slower than real time. SPICE, for example, cannot substitue for an actual electronics circuit (even if assuming
there was some kind of magical device that perfectly int
